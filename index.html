        <h1>The East Coast Logistics Temporary Website</h1>
        <p>This is the temporary website for East Coast Logistics while the new one is being constructed. You can find some of the latest news about the new website's progress
		on the home page.</p>
		<p>East Coast Logistics is an official virtual trucking company with Euro Truck Simulator 2 Multiplayer (ETS2MP), a Euro Truck Simulator 2 variant designed
		to allow players to play together and collaboratively. Consequently, the idea of a Virtual Trucking Company (VTC) was proposed and ECL was born. Check the 
		<a href="members.html">members page</a> to see all of the company's current members and check the <a href="apply.html">how to apply page</a> if you think ECL is right for you.</p>
		<p>View the company's ETS2MP Forums page <a href="http://forum.ets2mp.com/showthread.php?tid=4377">here</a>.</p>
		<p>IMPORTANT: The ETS2MP Group has announced that the forum section of their website will be shut down with the release of the beta version of the mod.</p>
		<h2>About The Company</h2>
		<p>We could ramble on about how ECL is a 'community' or a 'unique' company, but quintessentially, ECL is about creating a great experience for our drivers and virtual customers
		and further enhancing that level of realisticity. We enjoy a great laugh, but also enjoy the self-gratification from driving professionally. So, next time you see us on the road
		don't be shy, give us a horn. We'll always return the favor. That's what we do. That's who we are.</p>
		<p>East Coast Logistics' primary bases are Grimsby, UK and Newcastle-upon-Tyne, UK, providing the company with quick and simple access between the United Kingdom and continental Europe.</p>
		<p>We pride ourselves on having an extremely high standard of drivers and are dedicated to making every delivery a pleasant and professional experience for customers.</p>
		<h2>Website News</h2>
		<p>It is estimated that the website will be up around late September,
		however that could change depending on several unpredictable factors. The website will include many improvements over this one (obviously). Among those improvements is the ability to create an account
		which stores all of your load history and data, keeps a running tally of all of your loads, miles driven and all the other crazy information that you might want to know of!</p>
