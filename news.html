			<h6>By <a href="http://forum.ets2mp.com/member.php?action=profile&uid=8855">CEO GabrielAngelious</a> (on 15 August, 2014)</h6>
			<p>Hear ye, hear ye! We are trucking for Gaza. On August 29th 2014, [ECL] GabrielAngelious - a British Simulation Truck Driver - will drive for 24 hours 
			in convoy with his pilot trucks and fans in order to raise money to give aid to victims of the rising conflict between Israel and Hamas. This crisis has caused 
			thousands of people to flee their homes in fear and they are in desperate need of food, water, shelter and medical care. </p>
